# Roadmap

What's done, what's next, and what's parked. The client is feature-complete for day-to-day use; the road to 1.0 is about stability and trust rather than new features.

## Road to 1.0

- [ ] **0.13.0 stable**: release what is on `dev` to `main`, then give it real use.
- [ ] **Real-server tests**: run the core flows (sign in, browse, play, resume, mark watched, subtitles) in CI against real Jellyfin servers, old and current, so a break is caught by a failing check rather than by a user.
- [ ] **Decide 1.0's scope**: Linux, Windows, and Android phones and tablets are in. Android TV is either finished or stays marked experimental.
- [ ] **Translations**: open community translation, or ship 1.0 in English with translations welcome by pull request.
- [ ] **1.0.0 release candidate**: bug fixes only, for a few weeks.
- [ ] **1.0.0**

## Done

### Foundation

- [x] Connect to a Jellyfin server, sign in (including Quick Connect), and keep several accounts or servers signed in at once
- [x] Home, libraries, search, and rich detail pages
- [x] Follows current Jellyfin releases, including Jellyfin 12, with fallbacks that keep older servers working

### Movies, TV, and music

- [x] mpv-grade playback: direct play, transcode fallback, hardware decoding, audio passthrough, and a Playback Info overlay
- [x] Resume, Next Up, next and previous episode, skip intro, recap, and credits, an Up Next prompt, chapters, and trickplay previews on the scrubber
- [x] Every kind of subtitle: text, picture-based (PGS, VobSub), and subtitle files beside the video, with readable track names and online subtitle search through the server
- [x] A Continue Watching row that follows what you actually watch, one card per show
- [x] Extras, favorites, a watchlist, person pages, collections, and the Movie Night Wheel
- [x] Music: albums, a play queue, now playing, shuffle and repeat, synced lyrics, ReplayGain, and scrobbling
- [x] Offline downloads that behave like a real library

### Live TV, YouTube, and integrations

- [x] Live TV, an EPG guide, and DVR with series rules
- [x] Built-in ad-free YouTube client: search, subscriptions, playlists, comments, chapters, Shorts, a play queue, background audio, SponsorBlock, DeArrow, and downloads
- [x] Internet radio with live time-shift
- [x] Seerr requests, ratings (Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, community, and MDBList sources), watch together (SyncPlay), and casting to Chromecast and Google TV
- [x] Server administration: users, libraries, scheduled tasks, sessions, transcoding, networking, branding, Live TV, and plugins

### Player and interface

- [x] One shared player across Jellyfin and YouTube, with a picture-in-picture mini player and a pop-out window
- [x] A control bar you can style, remappable keyboard shortcuts, themes, a sleep timer, and a searchable settings screen
- [x] Layouts for foldable phones (tabletop) and screen reader support
- [x] Full interface internationalization (English source of truth, Weblate-ready)

### Release and reach

- [x] Self-contained Linux AppImage (x86_64 and aarch64)
- [x] Windows installer and portable zip
- [x] Android app for phones, tablets, and foldables, with Android Auto
- [x] Nix flake
- [x] In-app updates with a Stable or Dev channel
- [ ] Android TV (available, still experimental)
- [ ] macOS and iOS builds (pending Mac hardware and a paid Apple Developer account)

## Next

- [ ] Server backups from the admin screens
- [ ] A listening and watching stats screen for servers with the Playback Reporting plugin
- [ ] Collections you can create and edit, not just browse
- [ ] Styled ASS subtitles (anime fonts, colours, and positioning)
- [ ] YouTube channel video sorting (Latest, Popular, Oldest)

## Parked

- DLNA and AirPlay casting: Chromecast covers most homes, and "Play on device" remote control covers the rest
- YouTube watch-together (SyncPlay for YouTube): tiny audience and fragile against YouTube changes
- Distribution packages (AUR, Flathub, .deb): the AppImage, Windows, Android, and Nix builds cover every supported platform for now
